# Portfolio
This repo contains the projects that I, Allan Flores, have worked on in the past. 


## Websites

### [Personal Website](https://people.rit.edu/arf7094/235/project1/)

A (deprecated) portfolio website that details many of my projects (personal and academic), my resume, and contact information. A newer version using React and MUI is under construction. 

### [The Greedy Gamer Gizmo](https://people.rit.edu/arf7094/235/project2/)

This website utilizes the [Cheapshark API](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/) to let the user find the best game prices across many different online stores. You can search by store, name, max price, minimum rating, and more! Never pay full price again! All thanks to Cheapshark. 

### [A Fine Match! - A Matching Game](https://people.rit.edu/arf7094/235/project3/)

A fast paced mix between a memory match game and a turn-based battler. Try to match cards to progress in the battle, all while under a short time limit. You play a novice Cardcaster that is attempting to make their way through a dangerous hilly area, where they will fight their first battles in their journey to become the greatest mage ever and more currently, get out alive. You progress through the hills into a valley fighting sturdier enemies as you go.
