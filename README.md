# Portfolio
This repo contains the projects that I, Allan Flores, have worked on in the past. 


## Websites

### [Personal Website](https://people.rit.edu/arf7094/235/project1/)

A website that details many of my projects (personal and academic), my resume, and contact information. 

### [Discount Games Explorer](https://people.rit.edu/arf7094/235/project2/)

This website utilizes the [Cheapshark API](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/) to let the user find the best game prices across many different online stores. You can search by store, name, max price, minimum rating, and more! Never pay full price again! All thanks to Cheapshark. 

### [A Fine Match! - A Matching Game](https://people.rit.edu/arf7094/235/project3/)
